        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Muhammad Akbar Tantu, currently studying my Master of Commerce at UNSW with a focus on Business Analytics and Cyber Security. 
            Before coming to Sydney, I spent over ten years in the telecommunications industry, which taught me how operations, technology and customer needs connect in real life. 
            Now I’m building on that experience by learning how to turn data into insights and how organisations can manage digital risks. 
            I enjoy solving problems, breaking things down, and learning new tools that help me understand people and systems better.
